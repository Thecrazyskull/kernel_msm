* TI TPA6165A2

TPA6165A2 is a headset interface IC with a high-performance, low-power
DirectPath variable-attenuation Class-G stereo headphone amplifier,
variable=gain microphone pre-amplifier with bias, and advanced accessory
detection circuitry.

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		the string of "ti,tpa6165"
	- reg:
		the i2c slave address of the IC
	- interrupts:
		there is one interrupt line connected to the main SoC
	- interrupt-parent:
		The parent interrupt controller
	- gpios:
		an array specifiying the required GPIO for operation
			- IRQ GPIO

Example:

	i2c@1a200000 {
		status = "okay";

		qcom,i2c-bus-freq = <400000>;
		qcom,i2c-src-freq = <24000000>;

		tpa6165xx@40 {
			compatible = "ti,tpa6165";
			reg = <0x40>;
			interrupt-parent = <&pm8921_gpio>;
			interrupts = <38 0>;
			gpios = <&pm8921_gpio 38 0>;     /* IRQ */
		};
	};
